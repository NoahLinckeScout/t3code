# Claude

T3 Code uses Claude Code's login and configuration. Start with the default provider
for one account; [provider setup](./install.md#providers) covers installation and
shared provider settings.

## Separate accounts or configurations

Use a separate Claude config directory for each account. This also works for named
presets that need different Claude settings or a router connection.

Keep your existing account in the default directory. On the environment's machine,
create the second login:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude_personal
CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=~/.claude_personal claude auth login
```

Add another Claude instance in **Settings > Providers**:

| Instance        | Binary path | CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR path |
| --------------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Claude Work     | `claude`    | Leave empty            |
| Claude Personal | `claude`    | `~/.claude_personal`   |

An empty config-directory setting uses Claude Code's normal configuration. The
custom setting changes `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, leaving `HOME` and the system keychain
location intact. Use the same variable for the login command. Setting `HOME`
instead can put credentials where this provider will not find them.

Check the account reported in provider settings after signing in. Existing
threads can switch only between Claude instances with the same config directory.
Separate account directories stay isolated, including their local conversation
state. Claude does not have Codex's shared-home and shadow-home arrangement.

For presets that differ only in API keys or endpoints, use the instance's
**Environment variables**. Variable assignments do not belong in **Launch arguments**.

Claude Code's verbose mode can stay enabled when you use Claude for text generation, including
thread titles, branch names, commit messages, and pull request descriptions. On a remote connection,
T3 Code uses the Claude configuration on the connected server.

## Compact long conversations

Compaction windows are integers between `100000` and `1000000` tokens: Claude
summarizes the conversation at about that size. A window changes when
compaction happens, not the model's context window. Set them per model; a model
without one falls back to the provider's global window, then Claude Code's
default.

Set windows in `settings.json` under the Claude instance's
`autoCompactWindowByModel`, keyed by the model id Claude runs, context-window
suffix included. A custom model's id is its slug:

```json
"autoCompactWindowByModel": {
  "glm-5.3-flash-or": "350000",
  "claude-opus-5-5[1m]": "700000"
}
```

Here Claude Opus 5.5 compacts at 700,000 tokens with the 1M context window and
at Claude Code's default with 200k. A custom model entry can also carry its own
**Auto-compact window** in the instance's model list. Priority: the per-model
map, then the custom model entry, then the global window.

The upstream **Auto-compact after** field in the Claude provider settings still
works as the global fallback. The CLI compacts within the model's own context
window, so a global value below a model's context window is ignored for that
model rather than capping it — to compact a large-window model earlier, give
that model a per-model or custom-entry window, which always applies.

You can also send `/compact` in an existing conversation. Web and desktop offer
**Compact context** from the context meter and may suggest it when you return to
a large older thread. See [commands and skills](./composer.md#commands-and-skills)
for using composer commands.

## Usage limits

If your Claude subscription runs out of usage mid-turn, the thread shows which
limit was reached and the remaining wait when Claude provides a reset time.
Claude Code holds the turn until that window reopens, so it can keep showing as
working. Wait for the reset, or stop the turn and continue later. The warning's
timestamp shows when the displayed wait started.

## Skills

Claude skills come from the config directory's `skills` folder and the project's
`.claude/skills` folder. If both define the same name, the config-directory copy
wins. Skills disabled in Claude's settings do not appear in the composer.

Use `$` in the composer to select a skill. Skills marked `disable-model-invocation`
can still be started by you. Invoke those one per message: Claude directly runs
only the last named skill and may try to start earlier ones through its Skill
tool, which refuses skills reserved for manual invocation.

## OpenRouter

Create a Claude instance with its own config directory, such as
`~/.claude_openrouter`, and keep **Binary path** set to `claude`. In that instance's
**Environment variables**, use:

| Variable               | Value                                     |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`   | `https://openrouter.ai/api`               |
| `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN` | Your OpenRouter API key, marked Sensitive |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`    | An explicitly empty value                 |

If that Claude config directory has a cached Anthropic login, run `/logout` in a
Claude Code session using that directory before starting the router setup. Cached
login credentials can conflict with the router token.

Select the model you want in T3 Code. For an OpenRouter model outside the built-in
list, open that Claude instance in **Settings > Providers** and add its full model
ID with **Add custom model**. Then select it in the chat model picker.
`ANTHROPIC_DEFAULT_*_MODEL` variables map Claude Code aliases such as `sonnet`; they
do not replace the explicit model ID selected in T3 Code. Custom models may have
fewer effort, thinking, or context controls than built-in models.

Verify the model used in OpenRouter's activity dashboard. For current compatibility
requirements, use the
[OpenRouter Claude Code guide](https://openrouter.ai/docs/cookbook/coding-agents/claude-code-integration).

## Other routers

A local router uses an ordinary Claude provider instance. Give it a separate
config directory and put the router's endpoint and credential variables in that
instance's **Environment variables**. The router must run where the environment
can reach it. Follow the [Claude Code Router instructions](https://github.com/musistudio/claude-code-router)
for its installation and routing configuration.
